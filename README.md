## Project Description

The Smart Street Light System is designed to optimize energy consumption by automatically adjusting the intensity of street lights based on the presence of vehicles. The system utilizes Arduino, infrared sensors, and light-dependent resistors (LDRs) to achieve this functionality.

## Project Objectives

1. Automatic switching of streetlights.
2. Reduction in maintenance costs.
3. Energy-saving through intelligent control.
4. Improved system control based on real-time data.

## Components Used

- 💻 Arduino Uno
- 📻 Infrared Sensors
- 🔍 LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 💡 LEDs
- ⚙️ Other electronic components
- 🗃️ Registers
- 🔌 Jumper Wires

## Deployed on 🧰 Hardware

## System Operation

- During the daytime (LDR > 500), the street lights remain off.
- In the evening, when the LDR detects low light conditions, the system activates.
- The system adjusts the light intensity based on the number of obstacles detected by infrared sensors.
- Street lights switch to full intensity when a vehicle is detected.
- The system aims to save energy and reduce light pollution.

## Results and Discussion

The system has been tested and the results show effective control over street light intensity based on environmental conditions and vehicle presence.

## Future Scope

- Integration with IoT for remote monitoring and control.
- Speed estimation of vehicles.
- Number plate recognition for traffic management.
- Alerts and notifications for system faults.
